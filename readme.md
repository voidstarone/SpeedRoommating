# SpeedRoommating

SpeedRoommating is a SpareRoom service where people meet potential roommates while socialising in a public venue. Its app is used by SpareRoom employees to help speed up checking in attendees.

#todo: Please include a .md file with notes outlining and justifying your decisions, anything you would have done if you had more time, and any ideas for improvements.

Todo:   

* Look into race condition
* Fix bad abstraction in Repo
* Write document explaining things
* Build factory for events

Eventually the app will look like this: https://app.zeplin.io/project/602ce0601122751809bc2d9c/dashboard
