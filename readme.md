# SpeedRoommating

SpeedRoommating is a SpareRoom service where people meet potential roommates while socialising in a public venue. Its app is used by SpareRoom employees to help speed up checking in attendees.

#todo: Please include a .md file with notes outlining and justifying your decisions, anything you would have done if you had more time, and any ideas for improvements.

Also todo:
Uppercase table headings
Build no connection state
Build no data state
Build other tabs
